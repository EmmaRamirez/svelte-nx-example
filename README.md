# SvelteNxExample

- Built with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Getting Started

`npm i`

`nx serve ui`

Navigate to localhost:3000, and voila!

## Notes

- You may have to have `nx` installed globally (`npm i -g nx`)
- There are some ts errors related to modules and tsconfig, but they don't prevent the app from compiling
